1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:03,851
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:06,188
Light it up now!

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,591
So, tell me how it went.

4
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:12,493
Standard message and delivery.

5
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:13,527
Carl's dead.

6
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:15,363
That kid was the future.

7
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:17,833
The only future is one where you're dead.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,771
Yeah. Yeah, lead the way, D.

9
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,673
Hilltop is gonna learn

10
00:00:25,674 --> 00:00:27,975
to toe the line one way or another.

11
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,898
Dead or alive.

12
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:24,481
Welcome home, Dwighty boy.

13
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,186
I gotta say,

14
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,322
it is damn good having you back.

15
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:36,626
See, things gotta get done.

16
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,464
I need my top guys out in
front acing that shit.

17
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,202
Thanks.

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,499
Had yourself a close call, I hear.

19
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,777
I got ambushed.

20
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:55,779
I took this.

21
00:01:56,302 --> 00:01:58,615
The rest didn't walk away.

22
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:00,150
Well, until...

23
00:02:00,183 --> 00:02:03,353
I got to the woods, kept going.

24
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:06,156
You know, I headed toward Hilltop.

25
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,791
I figured our people would be

26
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:09,893
putting up a blockade sooner or later.

27
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:14,997
Good job.

28
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,567
But we pulled the blockade.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,204
Have to let the mice play
a little, 'cause, you know...

30
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:26,009
our people need to get
their business in order.

31
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:29,579
You'll see.

32
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:33,984
So, why don't you just slug a beer,

33
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:36,386
put on your best vest, and
get your ass downstairs,

34
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,388
'cause like I said...

35
00:02:39,923 --> 00:02:42,058
...we got work.

36
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:52,936
Get 'em good.

37
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,671
It's all right if they spill out.

38
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:57,607
I'm gonna gather up the
jackpots for refreshers,

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,244
and guts is guts.

40
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:05,115
Push it in nice and deep.

41
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:13,623
That's the stuff.

42
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:15,292
Holy damn!

43
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:18,094
This is gonna be all kinds of awesome.

44
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:22,232
Once the Hilltop just feels the
tip of what we are packin'...

45
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:28,037
...they are gonna drop to
their knees lickety-split.

46
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,544
Yes, sir.

47
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:04,241
Listen up!

48
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:08,478
Today is about scaring these people.

49
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:13,083
We're not going for head
shots, just flesh wounds.

50
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:18,688
Hit a few, leave 'em
livin', let 'em turn.

51
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,857
But don't kill 'em.

52
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,496
D.

53
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:28,498
Negan's handling his own transport,

54
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:30,367
so you can ride with me.

55
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,502
Well, I'm gonna scout ahead,

56
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:34,270
see if anything's coming our way.

57
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:35,705
Well, considerate thought,

58
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:37,941
but we got scouts scouting, right?

59
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:41,111
Far more expendable soldiers than you,

60
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:45,182
which is not to say you're
expendable... at all.

61
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,316
Listen, ride with me,

62
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,387
we make sure you're up
to speed on the plan.

63
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:51,955
It's what Negan wants,

64
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,724
so I don't know why we're still jawing.

65
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:57,127
He says, we do.

66
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:06,263
You look beautiful, baby.

67
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:33,473
Come here, sweetheart.

68
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:36,945
Yeah.

69
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:16,956
You know, I...

70
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,392
I look around and...

71
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:22,195
I think about the people that are gone...

72
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,599
...and the people that are still here.

73
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:31,503
It ain't right.

74
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,806
And it ain't fair.

75
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:37,643
Look, about...

76
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:39,178
what I did at Sanctuary,

77
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:41,614
trying to end it real quick...

78
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:46,585
I just wanted it done.

79
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,589
I didn't want to give
them another chance,

80
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,457
not again.

81
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,462
And I didn't care who was there.

82
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:58,463
I don't know if that makes it right or...

83
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,932
It does.

84
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:02,201
I didn't want to risk
killing innocent people.

85
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:05,438
I should've just been
worrying about our people.

86
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:08,541
Hell with anyone else.

87
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:10,209
We'll keep fighting...

88
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:11,711
until you're ready.

89
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:14,513
I'm ready.

90
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,350
Maggie's got lookouts out there.

91
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,818
Every half-mile,

92
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,620
waiting to signal each other, I know.

93
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:23,222
Yeah. I'm going, too.

94
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,891
To make sure we're all ready.

95
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:28,995
I'll go with you.

96
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,464
We should split up.

97
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:35,068
We're covering as much ground as we can.

98
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:39,439
All right.

99
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,044
I'm okay.

100
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:47,513
Yeah?

101
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,484
Okay.

102
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm gonna be okay.

103
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,526
Daryl...

104
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:04,263
Thank you...

105
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,532
for getting them here.

106
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:24,317
Think he'll come back from this?

107
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:28,921
Have you come back?

108
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,928
I just keep going.

109
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:46,338
Yeah.

110
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,141
They will, too.

111
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,211
It'll be harder after we finish this,

112
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:54,147
when it's quiet.

113
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:58,351
Not if Negan's dead.

114
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,954
Not for me, at least.

115
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,959
Not for me, either.

116
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:54,173
What do you make of this, D?

117
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,142
This?

118
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,212
This. Our little road trip?

119
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:03,181
Opportunity to close.
Nothing wrong with that.

120
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,118
Come on, D.

121
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,187
Let's rap here.

122
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:10,222
Let's get candid.

123
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,191
Let's get weird.

124
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:15,828
There's nobody here but us chickens.

125
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:21,233
Top guy to top guy,

126
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,002
I just want to know if, in your analysis,

127
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,873
you believe these people
are gonna cower and cave

128
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:32,211
after we deliver what amounts
to yet another warning.

129
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,646
Don't get paid to think.

130
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:35,799
Not true. Not true.

131
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,050
I value your perspective, Dwight.

132
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,586
You've been on both sides of the iron.

133
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,024
Well, if you're not gonna answer,

134
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,226
let me extemporaneously express

135
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,663
that I have my doubts
this little maneuver

136
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,633
is going to deliver the desired outcome.

137
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:56,668
You think we should do it different?

138
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:58,437
No. No, no.

139
00:12:58,471 --> 00:12:59,772
Not at all.

140
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:01,440
The big man's plan will get it done,

141
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,075
no question.

142
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:14,853
We've thrown a lot at Rick,

143
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:17,681
the widow, the King,

144
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:21,059
and they just keep
coming, keep fighting...

145
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,862
you've seen it, I've seen it.

146
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:26,265
Tallying it up, I keep
seeing the same answer...

147
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,568
they don't scare.

148
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,122
I don't know what the hell it is.

149
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,293
"If you fill the crates with
food or phonograph records,

150
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,629
I will gladly exchange them
for a key to your future"?

151
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:58,531
It lists coordinates
for our meeting spot.

152
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,506
This isn't the Saviors.

153
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,308
They'd blow through the gates,

154
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:10,943
make a big show.

155
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:13,108
This isn't that.

156
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:14,746
I wouldn't put nothin' past them.

157
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,016
Well, if it is a trap,
it's kind of obvious.

158
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:18,951
Which is what could make it a trap.

159
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,122
What if...

160
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:26,192
What if it's someone who
actually wants to help?

161
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,328
If someone is trying to
help us and we miss out,

162
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:30,763
we miss out.

163
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:33,016
If somebody's trying to kill us,

164
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,133
we die.

165
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:36,635
Not if we're careful.

166
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,971
Being careful is staying here.

167
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,975
I'll go.

168
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:43,829
I'll see what's up.

169
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,837
You go, I go.

170
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:46,170
Rick wants us here.

171
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:48,246
I know.

172
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,948
But the last time we
took a chance like this,

173
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:51,950
it changed everything.

174
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:54,153
Rick didn't agree with me then.

175
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,788
He may not understand me now.

176
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,355
He won't.

177
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:00,959
But eventually, he will.

178
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:02,728
He will.

179
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,068
Jesus and the others
have been scavenging,

180
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:11,370
and we're still starving.

181
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:14,172
Maybe this person does have
something that can help.

182
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,142
Then, I'm coming with you.

183
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:17,676
Okay.

184
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,379
I'll grab records, case this is real.

185
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:25,517
You get extra clips in case it isn't.

186
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,352
If you see 'em coming, hit your horn.

187
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,587
That'll start the handoff.

188
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,824
Stick to the plan, don't engage.

189
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:32,929
The hell was that?

190
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:34,564
That was Negan's car.

191
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:36,766
Jesus, it was.

192
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:41,404
Damn it!

193
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:55,523
You see it?

194
00:16:55,524 --> 00:16:57,267
Yeah, someone pegged
him... pegged him good.

195
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,889
Looked like just one guy,
from what I could tell.

196
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,325
Anyone see which way he went?

197
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:05,061
Just tell them to pipe down!

198
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:06,296
Stay icy.

199
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,696
May be more of them out there.

200
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:10,800
Keep guards up, scan your lane.

201
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,236
We could have company.

202
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,605
Let's go.

203
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:35,425
Stand down.

204
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,428
No runnin' off without a plan.

205
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:41,831
Car hit Negan's, pushed him off the road.

206
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:43,162
They headed that way.
Couldn't have gotten far.

207
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,835
Then, what are we waiting for?

208
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:46,660
It was just one driver.

209
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:49,901
It's nothing Negan can't
handle on his own.

210
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,352
But just in case,

211
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,290
Dwight and I'll go check it out.

212
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,283
- All right, we can back you up and...
- No.

213
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,759
This might be a ploy
to divide our forces,

214
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,928
and we're not gonna let that happen,

215
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:04,453
not when we're so close
to the master stroke.

216
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:07,471
I turned my truck to make sure
no one comes in this way.

217
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:10,993
Gary, I want you to do
the same down that end.

218
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,498
You're in charge.

219
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:18,454
Keep everyone in tight,
create a perimeter,

220
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:21,804
cut down anything that comes close.

221
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:28,678
Shall we locate our benefactor?

222
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,945
_

223
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,634
STAY OUT!

224
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,572
Hey, prick.

225
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:06,075
You are out of bullets.

226
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:11,681
Come on up.

227
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:21,023
Lucille!

228
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:35,805
Oh, you asshole.

229
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:58,566
Okay.

230
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:33,060
My name is Georgie,

231
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:35,918
and these are my friends,
Hilda and Midge.

232
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:37,320
And you are?

233
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,724
Suspicious.

234
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,726
But curious enough

235
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,930
to see what I have to
offer for food and music.

236
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:48,931
I do hope the records are music.

237
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:51,601
I don't accept spoken word.

238
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:52,835
If you're out here,

239
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:54,637
you know you can take care of yourselves,

240
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,071
and I like that.

241
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,775
I don't care to share this with the weak.

242
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,411
Good.

243
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:11,354
Enid.

244
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:26,169
None for me.

245
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:33,876
Give us what you have.

246
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,678
I'm afraid I can't do that.

247
00:22:35,712 --> 00:22:38,584
I come bearing knowledge to trade...

248
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:40,716
essential knowledge for the future,

249
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:42,384
primarily in my head,

250
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:45,721
and... I prefer to
keep that where it is.

251
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,153
You're trading knowledge.

252
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:49,491
That's what I have.

253
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:51,160
I've made the same offer before...

254
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:52,862
fill the crates, get the knowledge...

255
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:54,197
simple as that.

256
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,898
It's not a trick, just a fair trade.

257
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:57,132
I promise you.

258
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,968
It's an act of benevolence.

259
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:03,840
Why would you do that?

260
00:23:04,712 --> 00:23:07,243
What else should I do?

261
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:15,318
Rosita.

262
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:22,091
What's in there
isn't part of the deal.

263
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,193
There is no deal.

264
00:23:25,326 --> 00:23:27,429
How many communities have you found?

265
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:30,032
Communities like yours?

266
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:32,234
Not many at all.

267
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:35,338
And not one for a very long time.

268
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:39,676
What you have is special, unusual.

269
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,844
The dead have brought
out our best and worst,

270
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:45,014
and the worst has been
outpacing the best lately,

271
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,016
but that won't last forever.

272
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:48,718
It won't.

273
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,455
If, perhaps, people can
believe in people again,

274
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:55,458
four crates of goods is worth far less

275
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,459
than a sustainable future

276
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:01,364
and perhaps an exercise in trust.

277
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:03,965
I know...

278
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:07,069
"trust" probably sounds
like a made-up word now,

279
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:08,804
like flibberschticky.

280
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:10,873
Or klompf.

281
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:13,309
Or moisture.

282
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,678
Stop.

283
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,480
This isn't real.

284
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,715
No way anyone survives

285
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,717
going around doing what
you say you're doing.

286
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,485
But we do.

287
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,489
And we will, because I can divine

288
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:30,633
that you are a fine group,

289
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:33,129
manners notwithstanding.

290
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:40,503
We can make a deal.

291
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:44,740
No.

292
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,775
These people and their van

293
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:48,911
are coming with us back to Hilltop.

294
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:08,498
You still alive?

295
00:25:09,565 --> 00:25:11,634
I'm a goddamn cat.

296
00:25:17,173 --> 00:25:18,975
Come on, baby.

297
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:20,810
Where are you?

298
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,994
So, where's your people?

299
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,530
They should be here by now.

300
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,799
We didn't get that far.

301
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:45,734
Oh, they're coming.

302
00:25:45,768 --> 00:25:47,536
This is where you die...

303
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:51,674
...in the dark, all alone.

304
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,377
What the hell is your problem, Rick?

305
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,816
I mean, I know you're working
through some shit...

306
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:02,585
the worst kind of shit, I know...

307
00:26:02,618 --> 00:26:05,822
but if you aren't the most
stubborn know-it-all prick

308
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,557
I've ever crossed dicks with...

309
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:11,827
Why didn't you just let
me save you, Rick?

310
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,663
I'm good at it.

311
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:15,998
I saved everybody in the Sanctuary,

312
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,599
the Outpost, Hilltop, Kingdom...

313
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,068
I saved them all.

314
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,671
Their kids...

315
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:22,371
...can grow up safe.

316
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:26,208
They didn't lose one after we took over.

317
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:28,210
All those people

318
00:26:28,243 --> 00:26:32,014
were doing just fine before Rick Grimes!

319
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:39,327
EATERS

320
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:55,437
You've not only failed your boy,

321
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:58,274
you failed your people, Rick.

322
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:02,278
Kind of makes me sick
just thinking about it.

323
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,048
All that wasted potential.

324
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:10,086
But, see, there is still hope for you.

325
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:19,061
A one-time deal that I will make

326
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:21,063
in the memory of your bad-ass son,

327
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:23,933
someone that I actually respected.

328
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,672
You get Hilltop, Kingdom,
Alexandria to fall in line,

329
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:32,074
and our arrangement is back in place,

330
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,111
and you are forgiven, Rick.

331
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:40,983
I will lower my take from 50% to 25%...

332
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:43,485
a lousy 25%.

333
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,489
But you, you got to come work for me.

334
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:49,825
Janitorial to start... not bad at all.

335
00:27:49,858 --> 00:27:51,093
Your people,

336
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:53,528
they get to live like 75% kings!

337
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:57,933
Now, that is an epic freakin'
Christmas-Hanukah-Kwanzaa gift

338
00:27:57,966 --> 00:27:59,154
all rolled up into one,

339
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:03,105
considering what a thorn in
my ass cheek you've all been.

340
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:07,376
Now, why would I trust
any deal offered to me

341
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:10,980
after what you did to Jadis' people?

342
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:15,317
The hell are you talking about?

343
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,852
The Scavengers.

344
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:19,955
You killed them... all of them.

345
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,758
A whole community just wiped out.

346
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,868
Is that how you "save" people?

347
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:34,336
Son of a bitch.

348
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:36,539
Still just me and you...

349
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:39,341
even though plenty of your
people must've seen you go.

350
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:42,144
See... See, it's times like this,

351
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:44,780
you realize who your true friends are.

352
00:28:46,196 --> 00:28:48,109
No one's coming for you.

353
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:20,412
You must've thought about it,

354
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:21,981
clipping him yourself.

355
00:29:24,483 --> 00:29:27,952
You mean when he took my wife?

356
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:30,322
Or burned my face?

357
00:29:30,704 --> 00:29:32,824
No.

358
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:36,395
Never thought about that.

359
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:38,197
Not once.

360
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,569
But you didn't because
you chose to survive

361
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:47,772
instead of focusing on past discomforts.

362
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,475
You are an adult.

363
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:52,044
You did what you had to to live.

364
00:29:54,145 --> 00:29:57,482
And yet our leader is not doing the same.

365
00:29:57,516 --> 00:30:00,285
If it was my call...

366
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:02,655
we'd say enough.

367
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:05,991
We'd branch out, we'd find new places,

368
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:09,161
we'd make new relationships.

369
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:14,017
We'd make sure the Saviors survive,

370
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:16,034
as you chose to.

371
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:21,006
And we'd move on from past
discomforts as you...

372
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,808
wisely chose to.

373
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:32,984
Well, here I am,

374
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:34,820
my nuts blowin' in the breeze,

375
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:36,655
naked as a jaybird.

376
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,060
What do you say?

377
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:48,267
Just move on?

378
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,673
Just move on.

379
00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:35,347
Could be his.

380
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,286
Or the bucket he brought with him.

381
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:48,026
He could be anywhere, alive or dead.

382
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:50,095
Somewhere in between.

383
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:53,543
Just 'cause he walked away
doesn't mean he's breathing.

384
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:58,703
We can keep looking,

385
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:00,906
maybe find him more alive than dead,

386
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:03,108
but then what?

387
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:06,111
We could face a distasteful moment.

388
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:11,984
Or we could walk away.

389
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:15,720
Get back to our people

390
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:18,723
and make things even better.

391
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:23,061
This is a critical point
in our history, Dwight.

392
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:27,331
This is something we could
tell our grandkids about.

393
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:16,381
Good answer.

394
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:46,175
The handoff horn started up
but no confirmation hits.

395
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:48,513
Saviors could've slowed their roll.

396
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:50,682
Let 'em. We'll slow 'em down more.

397
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:52,183
That's good.

398
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:53,852
Be dark soon.

399
00:33:55,187 --> 00:33:56,655
Get people ready.

400
00:33:56,688 --> 00:33:58,690
You know what to do.

401
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,161
We should make the deal and let them go

402
00:34:03,195 --> 00:34:05,397
before the Saviors get here.

403
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,098
I can't let her go,

404
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,100
not with what they have.

405
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,470
I got too many mouths to feed.

406
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,305
They've quite of food in that van.

407
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:18,043
People here could be starving soon.

408
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:19,878
Maggie's right.

409
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:24,449
We take their stuff.

410
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,452
Otherwise, someone else will.

411
00:34:27,842 --> 00:34:29,921
Someone else will kill them.

412
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:32,291
It's a miracle they're
still alive, anyways.

413
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:38,263
The Saviors are on their way.

414
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,467
We're gonna fight, and
some of us will die,

415
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:43,605
so why should we give a shit

416
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:46,300
about people who don't give
a shit about themselves?

417
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,807
I mean, out there, living like that?

418
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,875
We take their stuff, and we use it.

419
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,878
We stop pretending that
things just work out.

420
00:34:54,282 --> 00:34:55,413
They don't.

421
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:57,281
Carl rescued Siddiq,

422
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:00,285
and now we have doctor,

423
00:35:00,318 --> 00:35:02,754
and we have a friend.

424
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,496
Carl was brave.

425
00:35:13,598 --> 00:35:15,834
And now he's dead.

426
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:19,104
Step back.

427
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:35,787
Things don't just work out.

428
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,760
No.

429
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:45,263
No, they don't.

430
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,336
But I think he knew that.

431
00:35:53,171 --> 00:35:57,842
He didn't give up on who
Rick wanted him to be.

432
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,944
And we can't

433
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:02,948
on who he wanted us to be.

434
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:05,350
We can't.

435
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:25,968
What you have...

436
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:29,674
oh, that was never gonna last.

437
00:36:29,707 --> 00:36:31,810
Sooner or later,

438
00:36:31,843 --> 00:36:35,580
you were gonna meet someone like me.

439
00:36:35,614 --> 00:36:38,226
You can't save me

440
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:41,586
or my people or even yours.

441
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,055
You can't save anyone,

442
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:47,426
because you don't care about anyone.

443
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:52,396
You use people to bring food...

444
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:56,401
to sleep with you...

445
00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:59,204
to protect you.

446
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:02,513
The only thing you care about...

447
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:04,075
is this bat.

448
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:08,079
You can't even save that.

449
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:11,416
I'll make you a deal.

450
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:14,519
I'll let you kiss her goodbye.

451
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,022
Don't you touch her!

452
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:25,563
Come and get her.

453
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:33,172
Shit, no!

454
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:52,330
Get your hands off of her.

455
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:12,884
Goddamn psychopath...

456
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,273
You're gonna kill us both.

457
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:16,754
Long as it's you first.

458
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:28,226
No spoken word?

459
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:29,428
I'm agreeing to your deal.

460
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:33,098
We'll fill your four
crates, then you can go.

461
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:35,695
You're gonna want that
to be sooner than later.

462
00:39:35,696 --> 00:39:37,402
I accept.

463
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:39,737
But I'm changing the terms.

464
00:39:40,204 --> 00:39:43,408
This one, no more.

465
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:45,009
In addition,

466
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:49,648
you can have a sizeable
portion of my food stores.

467
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,617
From the looks of things around here,

468
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,420
you need it far more than we do.

469
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:57,289
You're giving us food?

470
00:39:58,413 --> 00:39:59,627
In exchange for what?

471
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:02,761
Records and good faith.

472
00:40:02,794 --> 00:40:04,028
To be clear,

473
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:05,863
this isn't a gift, it's barter.

474
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:06,650
I'll be back.

475
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,795
Maybe not for a while, but I will,

476
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:14,372
and by then, I expect great things.

477
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:16,335
Here...

478
00:40:16,336 --> 00:40:19,972
is the aforementioned key to a future.

479
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:23,513
Inside, there are handwritten
plans for windmills,

480
00:40:23,514 --> 00:40:27,095
watermills, silos, hand-drawn schematics,

481
00:40:27,096 --> 00:40:31,615
guides to refining grain,
creating lumber, aqueducts...

482
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:35,660
a book of medieval human achievement

483
00:40:35,693 --> 00:40:38,997
so we may have a future from our past.

484
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,234
A KEY TO A FUTURE

485
00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:45,868
Yes, I know, the originals
are in my head,

486
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,369
but I made photocopies.

487
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,575
Still, it's been an evolving document

488
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:52,077
since the copy shop.

489
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:55,980
Thank you.

490
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:57,642
Build this place up.

491
00:40:57,643 --> 00:41:00,478
I want those other crates
filled when I get back...

492
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:03,888
cheeses for Hilda, pickles for Midge.

493
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:06,357
We'll see what we can do.

494
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:09,661
You will.

495
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:51,570
I killed Natania.

496
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:56,441
She was out there trying to
kill anyone she came across,

497
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:58,176
and we came across her.

498
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:02,280
So I killed her, and I'm alive,

499
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:05,417
and Carl saved someone, and he's dead.

500
00:42:06,228 --> 00:42:09,087
How the hell are we supposed to do this?

501
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,155
Are we supposed to just stop fighting?

502
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:22,434
I don't think Carl wanted us to
stop fighting for our future.

503
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:27,495
But I think he was telling us
that, to get to our future,

504
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:29,657
it's gonna take more than just fighting.

505
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:31,117
The Saviors are coming right now.

506
00:42:31,118 --> 00:42:33,912
And we're gonna fight them.

507
00:42:35,113 --> 00:42:38,650
But there's gotta be something after.

508
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:52,697
He's not with them.

509
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,605
Where's Negan?

510
00:43:03,263 --> 00:43:04,643
Gone.

511
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,180
You couldn't find him?

512
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:13,485
Just blood.

513
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:17,021
Now what?

514
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:19,346
What are we supposed to do now?

515
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,359
Who are you?

516
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:23,157
Negan.

517
00:43:23,158 --> 00:43:25,730
Who?!

518
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,275
Negan!

519
00:43:27,276 --> 00:43:28,423
I am Negan!

520
00:43:28,424 --> 00:43:31,076
Damn right you are!

521
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:33,640
We all are!

522
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:38,909
Don't matter if the big man ain't here.

523
00:43:38,943 --> 00:43:41,279
We're still Negan.

524
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:48,252
We don't know if he's "gone" gone.

525
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:52,290
He could very well be back.

526
00:43:54,227 --> 00:44:01,065
Our plan... Negan's plan
...was to go on to Hilltop

527
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:05,069
and put the fear of God in these people

528
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:07,672
so that, finally, once and for all,

529
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:09,808
they get with the program.

530
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:17,619
But after what just happened,
what they did to Negan,

531
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:24,322
that tells me that what we
need from them is beyond them.

532
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:31,029
It's time we come to accept that.

533
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,877
And once we do, it'll
become crystal clear

534
00:44:35,878 --> 00:44:41,305
there's only one thing left for us to do.

535
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:47,712
We must expunge them.

536
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:51,950
We must redact them!

537
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:59,824
They are a mistake that
we shall now erase.

538
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:06,564
We are moving on.

539
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,108
For Negan!

540
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:15,139
Yes?

541
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:16,224
For Negan!

542
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:40,598
Well, shit.

543
00:45:40,632 --> 00:45:41,788
Shut up.
